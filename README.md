***Stroke Prediction and Data Visualization with Machine Learning***


## **Introduction**

Nowadays, stroke is a major health-related challenge
Stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident, consists of a neurological disease that can result from ischemia or hemorrhage of the brain arteries, stroke affects about 16 million individuals worldwide and is associated with enormous societal costs , And in this project, we used algorithms that predict whether a stroke will occur or not, according to the health data entered.

## **Data Description**

The dataset contains of 5110 observations and 12 features.The following table explains the dataset in detail:
|Column name| Description| Column type|
|--|--|--|
|id| unique identifier |int
|age|age of the patient|float
|gender|male or female|object
|hypertension|if the patient has hypertension or not|int
|heart_disease|if the patient has any heart diseases or not |int 
|ever_married|if the patient married or not|object
|work_type| work type pf the patient |object
|Residence_type|residence type of the patient|object
|avg_glocuse_level|average glucose level in blood |float
|bmi|body mass index |float
|smoking_status|smoking status of the patient |object
|stroke|if the patient had a stroke or not |int

## **Used Tools:**

• Technologies:

Jupyter Notebook , Python

• Libraries:

Pandas , Numpy, Matplotlibe, Seaborn , Sklearn 

## **Algorithms:**

 - Logistic Regression
 
 - Decision Tree Classifier 
 
 -    Random Forest Classifier
 
 -    K-Neighbors Classifier
 
 -    Support Vector Classifier
 
 -    XGB Classifier


## **Questions:**

1. Is age a cause of stroke?
2. Who is more likely to have a stroke male or female?
3. Is smoking a cause of stroke?
